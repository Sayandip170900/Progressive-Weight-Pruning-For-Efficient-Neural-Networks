This project presents an end-to-end workflow for developing a time series model, starting from feature extraction and selection, through optimized model training, to post-training weight pruning. The process begins with extracting and engineering features from raw data, followed by a feature selection to identify the most impactful inputs. The model is then trained using optimized methods to ensure high accuracy and efficiency. After training, weight pruning is applied to introduce sparsity, minimizing model size without sacrificing performance. Finally, the results are visualized, showcasing model predictions and the impact of pruning on efficiency and accuracy.
